This is a web-based version of the game Hangman where you must guess the alphabets of a word within limited attempts.

## How to Play

This project has been deployed and can be acccessed [here](https://jocular-blini-b4245c.netlify.app/). <br>

The game is played by simply entering a letter you wish to guess and then pressing "Enter".
If the word contains the letter, its position in the word will be revealed by changing from '?' to the corresponding letter. All used letters will appear below the number of guesses you have left.
